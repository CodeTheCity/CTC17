# CTC17
Home repo for CTC17 - Make Aberdeen Better, which we held at ONE Codebase in Aberdeen on 9 and 10 November 2019. We had 20 participants on the Saturday.

A team working on making it easier to identify the routes most in need of improvement in public transport.

## [Greta](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/greta)
The aim of this is to build a carbon simulator for Aberdeen.

## [Rusty Batteries](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/rusty_batteries)
The aim if this is to help citizens to better understand the best route for disposal of a household waste - and guide them to the nearest facility for that.

## [Volunteering for All](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/volunteering_for_all)
A team look at making it easier for organisations to find volunteers, and for people to find organisations with which to volunteer.
